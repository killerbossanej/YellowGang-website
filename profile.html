   <pre>The history of the region until 1920 is given in more detail at Szepes county.

    Traces of settlement in the Neanderthal era have been found in remains at Gánovce (Gánóc) and Bešeňová (Besenyőfalu).
    
    The territory of Spiš was later populated first by Celts. It belonged to the state of Great Moravia (Veľká Morava), and after its dissolution
     became part of Poland.
    
    The southern part of the territory was conquered by the Kingdom of Hungary at the end of the 11th century, when the border of the Kingdom ended 
    near the modern town of Kežmarok. The royal county of Szepes (comitatus Scepusiensis) was created in the 2nd half of the 12th century. In the 1
    250s the border of the Kingdom of Hungary shifted to the north to Podolínec and in 1260 even further to the north (the Dunajec River). The nor
    theastern region around Hniezdne and Stará Ľubovňa, the so-called "districtus Podoliensis",
     was incorporated only in the 1290s. The northern border of the county stabilized in the early 14th century. Around 1300, the royal county 
     became a noble county.
    
    Many of the towns of Spiš developed from German colonization. The German settlers had been invited to the territory from the mid-12th century
     onwards. The settlements founded by them in southern Spiš were mainly mining settlements (later towns). Consequently, until World War II Spi
     š had a large German population (called Zipsers; see Carpathian Germans) who spoke Zipser German; now, the only Zipser-speaking town is Chmeľn
     ica (Hopgarten). Many smaller settlements were populated by settlers from Poland.
    
    In 1412, under the Treaty of Lubowla, 16 towns, two castles and a number of villages in Spiš were pawned to Poland by Sigismund of Luxembour
    g to finance his wars with the Republic of Venice in Dalmatia. Among the towns that for 360 years belonged to Poland were: Stará Ľubovňa, 
    Podolínec, Spišská Sobota, Poprad and Spišská Nová Ves.[2] In 1772 all were annexed by the Habsburg monarchy.
    
    In 1868, 21 Spiš settlements sent their demands, the 'Spiš Petition', to the Diet of the Kingdom of Hungary, requesting special status for
     Slovaks within the Kingdom.
    
    Spiš after the creation of Czechoslovakia
    In 1918 (and confirmed by the Treaty of Trianon in 1920), the county became part of newly formed Czechoslovakia. A tiny part of the territ
    ory (situated in today's Poland below the Rysy), amounting to 195 km² after an internal border dispute had been confirmed to be part of Ga
    licia (Central Europe) (at that time the western part of Austria-Hungary) as early as 1902. After World War I northern Spiš was united with P
    oland and became the subject of a long-running border dispute between Poland and Czechoslovakia. (See separate article, Czechoslovak-Polish border 
    dispute (1918-1947). In 1923 Slovak Spiš was divided between the newly formed Sub-Tatra county (Podtatranská župa) and Košice county (Коšická župa).
     In 1928-1939 and 1945-1948 it was part of the newly created Slovak Land (Slovenská krajina).
    

    During World War II, when Czechoslovakia was divided, Spiš was part of independent Slovakia, and formed the eastern part of Tatra county (T
    atranská župa) from 1940 to 1945. Slovakia joined the Axis, and the Polish part of Spiš (together with the Polish part of the county of Orava) was
     transferred to Slovakia. During the war all the Jews of the area were deported or murdered. When Soviet forces approached from the east at the end 
     of 1944, most of the ethnic Germans in Spiš fled westward, between mid-November 1944 and 21 January 1945 (see also Carpathian Germans). Their prope
     rty was confiscated after the war (see Beneš decrees).
    
    After World War II the prewar borders of Spiš were restored, with the most of the county going to Czechoslovakia, and a small part to Poland. In 
    1948, it became part of the newly created Košice Region (Košický kraj ) and Prešov Region (Prešovský kraj), whose borders however were completely d
    ifferent from those of the present-day regions of the same name. From July 1960 it became part of the newly created Eastern Slovak region (Východos
    lovenský kraj), which ceased to exist in September 1990.
    
    In 1993, Czechoslovakia was split and Spiš became part of Slovakia.
    
    Nationalities
    According to censuses carried out in the Kingdom of Hungary in 1869 (and later in 1900 and 1910) the population of Szepes county comprised the fo
    llowing nationalities: Slovaks 50.4%, (58.2%, 58%), Germans 35% (25%, 25%), Carpatho-Rusyns 13.8% (8.4%, 8%) and 0.7% (6%, 6%) Magyars (Hungarians).
    
    The current ethnic composition of the region, however, is much different. As mentioned above, many Jews and ethnic Germans were removed or left d
    uring World War II.
    
    Present-day Spiš has a number of Romani settlements and Romani are a substantial minority there.
    
    There are also 40,000-48,000 Gorals (Slovak: Gorali; literally Highlanders). Although a negligible number in census terms, they are a distinctiv
    e minority with their own culture, and speak a dialect of Polish (or Slovak-Polish dialect continuum[3] by some considered a language), especiall
    y elders.[4][5] They consider themselves as Slovaks and, in present, speak mostly Slovak language. Official Slovak 2011's census reported only 3084 Poles living in Slovakia.[6]
    
    Religion
    In the Spiš is the biggest and oldest churches a Roman Catholic Church and Evangelical Church of Augsburg Confession (Lutherans). In 1600 year w
    as biggest church a Evangelical Church. In the present is the biggest church a Roman Catholic Church.
    
    Economy
    Historically, economic activity in the region has been based principally on agriculture and forestry (formerly mining, too), which explains why
    
    
    
    
    
    Spiš belongs to the relatively poor regions of Slovakia.[citation needed] Since the late 19th century, tourism has helped th
    e local economy, and sanatoria and winter sports resorts have been built in the High Tatras and the Low Tatras, and areas such as 
    the Slovak Paradise (Slovenský raj) in the south-west and the Pieniny National Park at the Slovak-Polish border. Other tourist destinatio
    ns include the region's historical sites like Spiš Castle and nearby Spišské Podhradie, Spišská Kapitula, Žehra and the town of Levoča (all of
     which are listed by UNESCO as World Heritage Sites), Kežmarok, and Stará Ľubovňa Castle. The tourism industry has developed rapidly in Spiš, aid
     ed by the introduction of regular flights to Poprad Airport and improving rail and road connections.[citation needed]
    
    Spiš today
    Spiš today is one of Slovakia's 21 tourist regions but, unlike its predecessor, is not an administrative region.
    
    Since 1996, Spiš has been divided between the modern Košice Region and Prešov Region and is covered approxim
    ately by the following six administrative districts: Poprad, Kežmarok, Stará Ľubovňa, Spišská Nová Ves, Levoča and G
    elnica, except for the eastern half of the Stará Ľubovňa District that had been within Saris county and three villages of the 
    Poprad district (Štrba including Tatranská Štrba, Štrbské Pleso and Liptovská Teplička from Liptov county.)
    
    The present population of the Spiš region is about 320,000; almost half the population lives in towns, the largest of which are Pop
    rad (55,000), Spišská Nová Ves (39,000) and Kežmarok (17,000).he history of the region until 1920 is given in more detail at Szepes county.

    Spiš after the creation of Czechoslovakia
    In 1918 (and confirmed by the Treaty of Trianon in 1920), the county became part of newly formed Czechoslovakia. A tiny part of the territ
    ory (situated in today's Poland below the Rysy), amounting to 195 km² after an internal border dispute had been confirmed to be part of Ga
    licia (Central Europe) (at that time the western part of Austria-Hungary) as early as 1902. After World War I northern Spiš was united with P
    oland and became the subject of a long-running border dispute between Poland and Czechoslovakia. (See separate article, Czechoslovak-Polish border 
    dispute (1918-1947). In 1923 Slovak Spiš was divided between the newly formed Sub-Tatra county (Podtatranská župa) and Košice county (Коšická župa).
     In 1928-1939 and 1945-1948 it was part of the newly created Slovak Land (Slovenská krajina).
    

    During World War II, when Czechoslovakia was divided, Spiš was part of independent Slovakia, and formed the eastern part of Tatra county (T
    atranská župa) from 1940 to 1945. Slovakia joined the Axis, and the Polish part of Spiš (together with the Polish part of the county of Orava) was
     transferred to Slovakia. During the war all the Jews of the area were deported or murdered. When Soviet forces approached from the east at the end 
     of 1944, most of the ethnic Germans in Spiš fled westward, between mid-November 1944 and 21 January 1945 (see also Carpathian Germans). Their prope
     rty was confiscated after the war (see Beneš decrees).
    
    After World War II the prewar borders of Spiš were restored, with the most of the county going to Czechoslovakia, and a small part to Poland. In 
    1948, it became part of the newly created Košice Region (Košický kraj ) and Prešov Region (Prešovský kraj), whose borders however were completely d
    ifferent from those of the present-day regions of the same name. From July 1960 it became part of the newly created Eastern Slovak region (Východos
    lovenský kraj), which ceased to exist in September 1990.
    
    In 1993, Czechoslovakia was split and Spiš became part of Slovakia.
    
    Nationalities
    According to censuses carried out in the Kingdom of Hungary in 1869 (and later in 1900 and 1910) the population of Szepes county comprised the fo
    llowing nationalities: Slovaks 50.4%, (58.2%, 58%), Germans 35% (25%, 25%), Carpatho-Rusyns 13.8% (8.4%, 8%) and 0.7% (6%, 6%) Magyars (Hungarians).
    
    The current ethnic composition of the region, however, is much different. As mentioned above, many Jews and ethnic Germans were removed or left d
    uring World War II.
    
    Present-day Spiš has a number of Romani settlements and Romani are a substantial minority there.
    
    There are also 40,000-48,000 Gorals (Slovak: Gorali; literally Highlanders). Although a negligible number in census terms, they are a distinctiv
    e minority with their own culture, and speak a dialect of Polish (or Slovak-Polish dialect continuum[3] by some considered a language), especiall
    y elders.[4][5] They consider themselves as Slovaks and, in present, speak mostly Slovak language. Official Slovak 2011's census reported only 3084 Poles living in Slovakia.[6]
    
    Religion
    In the Spiš is the biggest and oldest churches a Roman Catholic Church and Evangelical Church of Augsburg Confession (Lutherans). In 1600 year w
    as biggest church a Evangelical Church. In the present is the biggest church a Roman Catholic Church.
    
    Economy
    Historically, economic activity in the region has been based principally on agriculture and forestry (formerly mining, too), which explains why
    
    
    
    
    
    Spiš belongs to the relatively poor regions of Slovakia.[citation needed] Since the late 19th century, tourism has helped th
    e local economy, and sanatoria and winter sports resorts have been built in the High Tatras and the Low Tatras, and areas such as 
    the Slovak Paradise (Slovenský raj) in the south-west and the Pieniny National Park at the Slovak-Polish border. Other tourist destinatio
    ns include the region's historical sites like Spiš Castle and nearby Spišské Podhradie, Spišská Kapitula, Žehra and the town of Levoča (all of
     which are listed by UNESCO as World Heritage Sites), Kežmarok, and Stará Ľubovňa Castle. The tourism industry has developed rapidly in Spiš, aid
     ed by the introduction of regular flights to Poprad Airport and improving rail and road connections.[citation needed]
    
    Spiš today
    Spiš today is one of Slovakia's 21 tourist regions but, unlike its predecessor, is not an administrative region.he history of the region until 1920 is given in more detail at Szepes county.

    Traces of settlement in the Neanderthal era have been found in remains at Gánovce (Gánóc) and Bešeňová (Besenyőfalu).
    
    The territory of Spiš was later populated first by Celts. It belonged to the state of Great Moravia (Veľká Morava), and after its dissolution
     became part of Poland.
    
    The southern part of the territory was conquered by the Kingdom of Hungary at the end of the 11th century, when the border of the Kingdom ended 
    near the modern town of Kežmarok. The royal county of Szepes (comitatus Scepusiensis) was created in the 2nd half of the 12th century. In the 1
    250s the border of the Kingdom of Hungary shifted to the north to Podolínec and in 1260 even further to the north (the Dunajec River). The nor
    theastern region around Hniezdne and Stará Ľubovňa, the so-called "districtus Podoliensis",
     was incorporated only in the 1290s. The northern border of the county stabilized in the early 14th century. Around 1300, the royal county 
     became a noble county.
    
    Many of the towns of Spiš developed from German colonization. The German settlers had been invited to the territory from the mid-12th century
     onwards. The settlements founded by them in southern Spiš were mainly mining settlements (later towns). Consequently, until World War II Spi
     š had a large German population (called Zipsers; see Carpathian Germans) who spoke Zipser German; now, the only Zipser-speaking town is Chmeľn
     ica (Hopgarten). Many smaller settlements were populated by settlers from Poland.
    
    In 1412, under the Treaty of Lubowla, 16 towns, two castles and a number of villages in Spiš were pawned to Poland by Sigismund of Luxembour
    g to finance his wars with the Republic of Venice in Dalmatia. Among the towns that for 360 years belonged to Poland were: Stará Ľubovňa, 
    Podolínec, Spišská Sobota, Poprad and Spišská Nová Ves.[2] In 1772 all were annexed by the Habsburg monarchy.
    
    In 1868, 21 Spiš settlements sent their demands, the 'Spiš Petition', to the Diet of the Kingdom of Hungary, requesting special status for
     Slovaks within the Kingdom.

    Spiš today
    Spiš today is one of Slovakia's 21 tourist regions but, unlike its predecessor, is not an administrative region.
    
    Since 1996, Spiš has been divided between the modern Košice Region and Prešov Region and is covered approxim
    ately by the following six administrative districts: Poprad, Kežmarok, Stará Ľubovňa, Spišská Nová Ves, Levoča and G
    elnica, except for the eastern half of the Stará Ľubovňa District that had been within Saris county and three villages of the 
    Poprad district (Štrba including Tatranská Štrba, Štrbské Pleso and Liptovská Teplička from Liptov county.)
    
    The present population of the Spiš region is about 320,000; almost half the population lives in towns, the largest of which are Pop
    rad (55,000), Spišská Nová Ves (39,000) and Kežmarok (17,000).he history of the region until 1920 is given in more detail at Szepes county.

    Poprad district (Štrba including Tatranská Štrba, Štrbské Pleso and Liptovská Teplička from Liptov county.)
    
    The present population of the Spiš region is about 320,000; almost half the population lives in towns, the largest of which are Pop
    rad (55,000), Spišská Nová Ves (39,000) and Kežmarok (17,000).he history of the region until 1920 is given in more detail at Szepes county.

    Traces of settlement in the Neanderthal era have been found in remains at Gánovce (Gánóc) and Bešeňová (Besenyőfalu).
    
    The territory of Spiš was later populated first by Celts. It belonged to the state of Great Moravia (Veľká Morava), and after its dissolution
     became part of Poland.
    
    The southern part of the territory was conquered by the Kingdom of Hungary at the end of the 11th century, when the border of the Kingdom ended 
    near the modern town of Kežmarok. The royal county of Szepes (comitatus Scepusiensis) was created in the 2nd half of the 12th century. In the 1
    250s the border of the Kingdom of Hungary shifted to the north to Podolínec and in 1260 even further to the north (the Dunajec River). The nor
    theastern region around Hniezdne and Stará Ľubovňa, the so-called "districtus Podoliensis",
     was incorporated only in the 1290s. The northern border of the county stabilized in the early 14th century. Around 1300, the royal county 
     became a noble county.
    
    Many of the towns of Spiš developed from German colonization. The German settlers had been invited to the territory from the mid-12th century
     onwards. The settlements founded by them in southern Spiš were mainly mining settlements (later towns). Consequently, until World War II Spi
     š had a large German population (called Zipsers; see Carpathian Germans) who spoke Zipser German; now, the only Zipser-speaking town is Chmeľn
     ica (Hopgarten). Many smaller settlements were populated by settlers from Poland.
    
    In 1412, under the Treaty of Lubowla, 16 towns, two castles and a number of villages in Spiš were pawned to Poland by Sigismund of Luxembour
    g to finance his wars with the Republic of Venice in Dalmatia. Among the towns that for 360 years belonged to Poland were: Stará Ľubovňa, 
    Podolínec, Spišská Sobota, Poprad and Spišská Nová Ves.[2] In 1772 all were annexed by the Habsburg monarchy.
    
    In 1868, 21 Spiš settlements sent their demands, the 'Spiš Petition', to the Diet of the Kingdom of Hungary, requesting special status for
     Slovaks within the Kingdom.
    
    Spiš after the creation of Czechoslovakia
    In 1918 (and confirmed by the Treaty of Trianon in 1920), the county became part of newly formed Czechoslovakia. A tiny part of the territ
    ory (situated in today's Poland below the Rysy), amounting to 195 km² after an internal border dispute had been confirmed to be part of Ga
    licia (Central Europe) (at that time the western part of Austria-Hungary) as early as 1902. After World War I northern Spiš was united with P
    oland and became the subject of a long-running border dispute between Poland and Czechoslovakia. (See separate article, Czechoslovak-Polish border 
    dispute (1918-1947). In 1923 Slovak Spiš was divided between the newly formed Sub-Tatra county (Podtatranská župa) and Košice county (Коšická župa).
     In 1928-1939 and 1945-1948 it was part of the newly created Slovak Land (Slovenská krajina).
    

    During World War II, when Czechoslovakia was divided, Spiš was part of independent Slovakia, and formed the eastern part of Tatra county (T
    atranská župa) from 1940 to 1945. Slovakia joined the Axis, and the Polish part of Spiš (together with the Polish part of the county of Orava) was
     transferred to Slovakia. During the war all the Jews of the area were deported or murdered. When Soviet forces approached from the east at the end 
     of 1944, most of the ethnic Germans in Spiš fled westward, between mid-November 1944 and 21 January 1945 (see also Carpathian Germans). Their prope
     rty was confiscated after the war (see Beneš decrees).
    
    After World War II the prewar borders of Spiš were restored, with the most of the county going to Czechoslovakia, and a small part to Poland. In 
    1948, it became part of the newly created Košice Region (Košický kraj ) and Prešov Region (Prešovský kraj), whose borders however were completely d
    ifferent from those of the present-day regions of the same name. From July 1960 it became part of the newly created Eastern Slovak region (Východos
    lovenský kraj), which ceased to exist in September 1990.
    
    In 1993, Czechoslovakia was split and Spiš became part of Slovakia.
    
    Nationalities
    According to censuses carried out in the Kingdom of Hungary in 1869 (and later in 1900 and 1910) the population of Szepes county comprised the fo
    llowing nationalities: Slovaks 50.4%, (58.2%, 58%), Germans 35% (25%, 25%), Carpatho-Rusyns 13.8% (8.4%, 8%) and 0.7% (6%, 6%) Magyars (Hungarians).
    
    The current ethnic composition of the region, however, is much different. As mentioned above, many Jews and ethnic Germans were removed or left d
    uring World War II.
    
    Present-day Spiš has a number of Romani settlements and Romani are a substantial minority there.
    
    There are also 40,000-48,000 Gorals (Slovak: Gorali; literally Highlanders). Although a negligible number in census terms, they are a distinctiv
    e minority with their own culture, and speak a dialect of Polish (or Slovak-Polish dialect continuum[3] by some considered a language), especiall
    y elders.[4][5] They consider themselves as Slovaks and, in present, speak mostly Slovak language. Official Slovak 2011's census reported only 3084 Poles living in Slovakia.[6]
    
    Religion
    In the Spiš is the biggest and oldest churches a Roman Catholic Church and Evangelical Church of Augsburg Confession (Lutherans). In 1600 year w
    as biggest church a Evangelical Church. In the present is the biggest church a Roman Catholic Church.
    
    Economy
    Historically, economic activity in the region has been based principally on agriculture and forestry (formerly mining, too), which explains why
    
    
    
    
    
    Spiš belongs to the relatively poor regions of Slovakia.[citation needed] Since the late 19th century, tourism has helped th
    e local economy, and sanatoria and winter sports resorts have been built in the High Tatras and the Low Tatras, and areas such as 
    the Slovak Paradise (Slovenský raj) in the south-west and the Pieniny National Park at the Slovak-Polish border. Other tourist destinatio
    ns include the region's historical sites like Spiš Castle and nearby Spišské Podhradie, Spišská Kapitula, Žehra and the town of Levoča (all of
     which are listed by UNESCO as World Heritage Sites), Kežmarok, and Stará Ľubovňa Castle. The tourism industry has developed rapidly in Spiš, aid
     ed by the introduction of regular flights to Poprad Airport and improving rail and road connections.[citation needed]
