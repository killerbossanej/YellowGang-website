          The indefinite article takes two forms. It’s the word a when it
          precedes a word that begins with a consonant. It’s the word an when it
          precedes a word that begins with a vowel. The indefinite article
          indicates that a noun refers to a general idea rather than a
          particular thing. For example, you might ask your friend, “Should I
          bring a gift to the party?” Your friend will understand that you are
          not asking about a specific type of gift or a specific item.

        <p>“I am going to bring an apple pie,” your friend tells you.
       
          Again, the indefinite article indicates that she is not talking about
          a specific apple pie. Your friend probably doesn’t even have any pie
          yet. The indefinite article only appears with singular nouns. Consider
